    <p>Dear Haathi,<br>
        <br>
        I AM SO FUCKING SORRY NA. <br>
        (you forgot too ek baar pahale zyada matt bolo) 
        <br><br>
        Yes soooo.... IT HAS BEEN HALF AN YEAR OF US DATING!!!!!! 😋😋😋😋🎀🎀🎀🎀🎉🎉🎉🎉
        <br><br>
        This best half an year of my life was so magical and wonderful. I am sorry that again we couldn't go on a lot of dates this month but man, everything we did this month was so fun 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻.
        <br><br>
        Never have I ever - NEVER HAVE I EVER watched a movie for someone without being into the franchise and knowing about it - but here we are, this girl makes me watch 'Inside Out 2' and I enjoyed it so fucking much - even more than the girl herself 😭🙏🏻. <br> (Although, yes I wasn't doing a lot of the 'watching' and more involved with other things) <br> (Also remind me to tease you about u saying no to watch Haikyuu with me after u read this para)
        <br><br>
        Also bhai, aapka jhoota kha kha ke lagta hai aapka appetite mujhe pass on ho gaya hai, how the fuck could BOTH of us together not finish a plate of Chaat Paapdi or a bucket of fried chicken 😭. Need to get my game back up and stop letting your tasty ass saliva affect me 😡.
        <br><br>
        I also made you cry another time this month 😞 (cry per month rate barkaraar hai 💪). Do not ever dare to play such a prank with me again (reminder). I love you so much and your slightest of words can change my life. Although yes, of course I definitely overreacted too. I'm sorry, I love you, the prank just confirmed even more how much I love you so I just take it positively now.
        <br><br>
        Thank you so much for being the most mature girlfriend ever. I'm so proud of you for being so hard-working and being able to study this consistently. I'm also so proud of you for trying out this internship and giving it a go, I'm sure you'll get to the right decision and be able to decide what you wanna do. <br> I'm always there as well for advice and getting pissed off when you don't go with it 😝 (no pressure)
        <br><br>
        Here's to so many more Starbucks dates (or maybe not in Starbucks but as expensive places with actual good food - you get the point ahshshsjja)
        <br><br>
        <br><br>
        Happy 6 months anniversary!!
        <br><br>
        I love you so much<br>
        Pratham
