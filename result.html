    <p>Dear Haathi,<br>
        <br>
        Thank you for today, it all worked out because of your prayers, I'm sure. Only a cute innocent kuchupuchu golumolu bacha can convince God!!!!! 😭 (YES I WILL CRINGE IF YOU REMIND ME THAT I AM A GROWN ASS MAN AND STILL WRITING THIS SHIT)
        <br><br>
        ANYWAYS ITS BEEN 7 MONTHS OF US DATING! (Can't blv I have been handling ur ass for more than half an year 😜😜😜)
        <br><br>
        I am so proud of you for completing the internship and being so particular about it 🥹🥹🥹 and I fucking loved dropping you to the office, giving you a kiss on the cheek and seeing your smile. THAT smile - OH MY GOD so cute I will never forget it and that moment. (Can't wait for the day where you drop me to the office too 👉👈).
        <br><br>
        I am absolutely loving the fact that we are watching Mahabharat together, I can tell our kids that I was the one who made their mom get to know about it. (I will also mention all the times you get angry whenever I tease you for not knowing anything from it - LOST CASE😁🥰🔥)
        <br><br>
        I miss you. I want to touch you. I need you. And I can't wait to get it this morning. 😚😚😚😚😚🫦🫦🫦
